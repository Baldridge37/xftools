## Compile

Only seems to work with a later version of seqan. I don't know why. Use local version here along with my seqan edit for this

```
~/cmake-3.6.0-rc2-Linux-x86_64/bin/cmake ../bam_2_w1_extractor -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=./seqan/util/cmake -DSEQAN_INCLUDE_PATH=./seqan/include -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-std=c++14 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```
